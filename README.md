VIRTUAL MACHINE
Virtual Machines are software environments that simulate a physical computer. They allow multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical machine, isolating them from each other and providing a secure, flexible, and efficient computing environment.

How Virtual Machines Work:

Hypervisor: A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor, manages the allocation of resources (CPU, memory, storage, network) to each virtual machine.

Guest Operating Systems: Each virtual machine runs its own guest operating system, which is unaware that it's running on a virtualized environment.

Resource Allocation: The hypervisor allocates resources to each guest OS based on predefined policies, ensuring fair sharing and preventing one VM from impacting the performance of others.

Types of Virtualization:

- Type 1 Hypervisor: Runs directly on the hardware, providing optimal performance but requiring specialized hardware or software. Examples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V.

- Type 2 Hypervisor: Runs as an application on top of a host operating system. This is more common for personal use or smaller-scale deployments. Examples: VirtualBox, VMware Workstation.
