What is computer science?

Computer scienceis the study of computers and computational systems. It encompasses the theory, design, development, and application of software and hardware. While computers are often at the center of the field, computer science is more about the underlying principles that make them work.   

Key areas of computer science include:

• Algorithms and data structures: These are the fundamental building blocks of computer programs, defining how information is processed and stored.   

• Programming languages: These are tools used to communicate instructions to computers.   

• Software engineering: This involves the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.   

• Artificial intelligence: This focuses on creating intelligent agents that can reason, learn, and act autonomously.   

• Computer networks: This deals with the design, implementation, and maintenance of computer networks.   

• Computer graphics: This involves the creation and manipulation of visual images on computers.   

• Human-computer interaction: This explores how people interact with computers and other technology.

What is computation?

Computation is the process of performing calculations or solving problems using a set of rules or algorithms. In simpler terms, it's the act of taking input data and transforming it into output data through a series of steps.

Key aspects of computation include:

• Input: The data that is processed.

• Process: The series of steps or operations performed on the input data.

• Output: The result of the computation.

- CPU: General-purpose processor for executing instructions.

- GPU: Specialized processor for graphics and visual effects.

- NIC: Handles network communication.

- TPU: Specialized processor for machine learning.

System on a Chip (SoC)

A System on a Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit (IC) that integrates multiple components of an electronic system, typically including:

Processor cores: These can be general-purpose CPUs, specialized processors (like GPUs or DSPs), or a combination.

Memory: This includes both main memory (RAM) and storage (e.g., flash memory).

Peripherals: These are components that interact with the outside world, such as I/O interfaces (USB, Ethernet, etc.), sensors, and actuators.

Interconnect: This is the network of connections that allows the various components to communicate with each other.

STORAGE

Primary Storage (Main Memory) 
 
 • Types:

- RAM (Random Access Memory): Most common type, offering fast read/write access to data.

- ROM (Read-Only Memory): Stores data permanently and cannot be modified.

- Cache Memory: Small, high-speed memory used to store frequently accessed data for faster retrieval.


Secondary Storage

 Used for long-term data retention and has a much larger capacity compared to primary storage.

These are non-volatile: Retains data even when the power is off.
Slower access speed compared to primary storage.
Larger capacity than primary storage.
 
•	Types:

-	Hard Disk Drives (HDDs): Traditional storage devices with magnetic disks for data storage.

-	Solid-State Drives (SSDs): Use flash memory for faster data access and have no moving parts.

-	Optical Discs (CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays): Use laser technology to read/write data on a reflective surface.

-	Magnetic Tapes: Used for large-scale data archiving and backup.

NETWORK

•Types: 


LAN and WAN

 LAN 
 (Local Area Network) 
A network that connects computers and other devices within a limited geographic area, typically a single building or campus.

Characteristics:

Small physical area.

High data transfer rates.

Managed by a single organization.

Examples: Home networks, office networks, school networks.

WAN
(Wide Area Network)
 A telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents.

Characteristics:

Large physical area.

Lower data transfer rates compared to LANs.

Managed by multiple organizations. 

Examples: The internet, corporate networks connecting multiple offices.

OPERATING SYSTEM(OS)

An operating system (OS) is a type of system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. It serves as an intermediary between a computer's users and its hardware, enabling them to interact with the machine through a user interface. 


Commonly Used Operating Systems:

Windows: Developed by Microsoft, Windows is the most widely used desktop operating system, known for its user-friendly interface and extensive software compatibility.   

macOS: Developed by Apple for its Macintosh computers, macOS is renowned for its elegant design, seamless integration with Apple hardware, and robust security features.

Linux: An open-source operating system, Linux is highly customizable and versatile, running on a wide range of hardware from servers to embedded devices. It is known for its stability, security, and performance. There are two main families of Linux distributions:

Debian: A popular distribution based on the Debian Project, known for its stability and community support. Debian includes Ubuntu, a widely used desktop and server distribution.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL): A commercial distribution developed by Red Hat, known for its enterprise-grade features, reliability, and security. RHEL includes CentOS, a community-supported version of RHEL, Oracle Linux, Fedora, and Red Hat.
