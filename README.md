What is computer science?

Computer scienceis the study of computers and computational systems. It encompasses the theory, design, development, and application of software and hardware. While computers are often at the center of the field, computer science is more about the underlying principles that make them work.   

Key areas of computer science include:

Algorithms and data structures: These are the fundamental building blocks of computer programs, defining how information is processed and stored.   

Programming languages: These are tools used to communicate instructions to computers.   

Software engineering: This involves the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.   

Artificial intelligence: This focuses on creating intelligent agents that can reason, learn, and act autonomously.   

Computer networks: This deals with the design, implementation, and maintenance of computer networks.   

Computer graphics: This involves the creation and manipulation of visual images on computers.   

Human-computer interaction: This explores how people interact with computers and other technology.  

What is computation?

Computation is the process of performing calculations or solving problems using a set of rules or algorithms. In simpler terms, it's the act of taking input data and transforming it into output data through a series of steps.

Key aspects of computation include:

Input: The data that is processed.

Process: The series of steps or operations performed on the input data.

Output: The result of the computation.

CPU: General-purpose processor for executing instructions.

GPU: Specialized processor for graphics and visual effects.

NIC: Handles network communication.

TPU: Specialized processor for machine learning.

System on a Chip (SoC)

A System on a Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit (IC) that integrates multiple components of an electronic system, typically including:

Processor cores: These can be general-purpose CPUs, specialized processors (like GPUs or DSPs), or a combination.

Memory: This includes both main memory (RAM) and storage (e.g., flash memory).

Peripherals: These are components that interact with the outside world, such as I/O interfaces (USB, Ethernet, etc.), sensors, and actuators.

Interconnect: This is the network of connections that allows the various components to communicate with each other.
